# 3DDistribution
Modelling 3D distributions of marine mammal detections from eDNA samples

# The Plan

Repo will contain code, data must be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EZEfbxgRszwmN4RmaoQe7wh6S6zPgm5A?usp=drive_link) and placed in a folder named "Data".

# Analysis 1

- collapse all data across X and Y
- does detection probability vary across depth?
- by species or species functional type?
- by # of technical replicates (aka volume)?

# Analysis 2

- develop 2D models of distribution for each species
- given that distribution, does sampling depth matter?
- does it vary by species or species type?
- by # of technical replicates (aka volume)?
